  <h3 class="text-xl">Why this exists</h3>
  <p>
    Google’s search experience has shifted: an AI-first “overview” often sits
    between you and the web results you want, preferencing condensed answers and
    generative summaries before the traditional list of links that you've come
    to know and love.
  </p>
  <p>
    For many users this is helpful; for others it’s friction. People who want to
    see original web sources, do comparative searching, or quickly scan the web
    results now face an extra layer that can — counterintiotively — slow you
    down and obscure the source of information.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are also much broader consequences with far-reaching and unconsidered
    side effects. Generative AI results require additional server-side
    computation every time they’re requested, which drastically increases the
    energy and carbon footprint of a single search, compared with returning <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache">cached</a
    >, index-based web links.
  </p>
  <p>
    When millions of searches are routed through AI pipelines by default, that
    incremental cost adds up. This project isn’t an attack on progress — it’s a
    response to a simple idea: users should be able to choose how they search,
    and those who prefer the traditional, source-forward results should have an
    easy, lightweight option.
  </p>
  <p>
    There currently doesn't exist a way for users to disable “AI overview”; the
    only way is to select the “Web” tab in Google, but by then it's too late.
    This tool solves that problem by sending you to the Web tab immediately,
    bypassing the AI overview entirely.
