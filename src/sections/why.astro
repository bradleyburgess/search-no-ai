  <h3 class="text-xl">Why this exists</h3>
  <p>
    Google’s search experience has shifted: an AI-first “overview” often appears
    before traditional web results, preferencing condensed answers and
    AI-generated summaries before the traditional list of links that you've come
    to know and love.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are a number of reasons why this shift is problematic. First, it is
    difficult to know the sources of the information supplied by the AI
    overview. This makes it harder to fact check and do comparative searching.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, there are some massive environmental implications to this change.
    Generative AI results require a great deal of additional server-side
    computation every time they’re requested, which drastically increases the
    energy and carbon footprint of a single search, compared with returning <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache">cached</a
    >, index-based web links.
  </p>
  <p>
    When millions of searches are routed through the AI pipelines by default,
    that incremental cost adds up very quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
    There currently doesn't exist a way for users to disable “AI overview”. One
    can select the “Web” tab on the results page, but by then it's too late.
    This tool solves that problem by sending you to the Web tab immediately,
    bypassing the AI overview entirely.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project isn’t an attack on AI. It’s a response to the shift mentioned
    above, and represents two simple ideas: (1) Users should be able to choose
    how they search, and (2) AI shouldn't be opt-in by default, especially with
    no way to opt out.
