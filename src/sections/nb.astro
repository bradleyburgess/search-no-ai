  <h4>Affiliation</h4>
  <p>
    This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Google
    LLC. It simply redirects your search query to Google Search using a publicly
    available URL parameter (<code>&udm=14</code>), which opens the Web results
    tab directly instead of the AI-generated overview on the “All” tab. This
    site makes no modifications to Google Search or its content — it only
    changes which results view is loaded.

  <p>
    All trademarks, logos, and search results remain the property of their
    respective owners.

  <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
  <p>
    This site does not collect, log, or share any personal data, search queries,
    analytics, or usage statistics.
  </p>
  <p>No cookies are used for tracking or advertising purposes.</p>
  <p>
    The only data stored on your device is your theme preference (light or dark
    mode), which is saved locally in your browser’s <code>localStorage</code> so
    that your preference persists between visits.
  </p>
  <p>
    This information never leaves your device and cannot be accessed by the site
    owner or any third party.
  </p>
  <p>
    All searches are handled directly by Google. When you perform a search, your
    query is sent to Google, and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
      >their Privacy Policy</a
    > applies to the results you see.
